I designed these earrings/phone charms in Onshape as part of a recruitment campaign to improve the diversity of the robotics CAD team. The gear and bolt (a team motif) are printed separately in black and red to represent the team colors. I designed them with a millimeter of tolerance in between so they can snap together afterwards to assemble the final piece.
