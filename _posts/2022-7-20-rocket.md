We took this rocket design to first place in the American Rocketry Contest and second at the International Rocketry Challenge. The objective is to launch a rocket to a specified altitude target within a time range. The further away you are from each increases your points - 0 is best.

The overall design philosophy we focused on was to make everything as modular as possible. The more flexibility you build into your rocket, the more you can adjust to any conditions. For us, this meant using rivets to non-permanently hold together body sections and making multiple backups of every part. From top to bottom, the rocket has a rounded ogive nosecone, a BT-80 payload section carrying two egg "passengers" (horizontally as per the rules), a transition containing an altimeter bay, a BT-70 booster section containing a parachute in nomex cloth and an F70-14A motor.

3D printed parts are another vital piece of the rocket. The nosecone, altimeter bay & sled, and fins are printed from PETG. 3D printing allows us to rapidly test different variations on the dimensions of each part and spend more time manufacturing other sections. We used trapezoidal fins as a compromise between easily printable geometry and aerodynamic efficiency. Additionally, they're printed on their leading edge with tangs. The leading edge orientation makes them much more resistant to shearing or snapping on a hard landing, an issue we've faced in the past. Tangs (the rectangular protrusion that goes inside the booster section) make the construction more robust as well. These features were successful - we didn't lose a single fin this year.

The altimeter bay/sled have gone through a few iterations, mostly making it easier to use or fit. It lets us put the altimeter within a central transition section which can help our stability margin by shifting the center of the gravity of the rocket downward as opposed to the more common altimeter in foam nosecone.

Here's a test launch after the national competition with our international rocket which I painted with a United States livery. Pretty straight launch, solid altitude as well.
