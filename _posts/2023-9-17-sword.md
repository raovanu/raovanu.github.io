Taking an art history class (shoutout Mr. Prufer), it felt wrong not to put any of the principles we learned into practice. I thought the motifs within Christian artwork were especially interesting so I decided to design this sword. Incorporating elements from class as well as some creative liberties of my own, this piece is my largest 3D printed project yet, requiring the assembly of 8 individual prints.
