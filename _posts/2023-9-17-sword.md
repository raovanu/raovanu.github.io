Taking an art history class (shoutout Mr. Prufer), it felt wrong not to put any of the principles we learned into practice. I thought the motifs within Christian artwork were especially interesting so I decided to design this sword. Incorporating elements from class as well as some creative liberties of my own, this piece is my largest 3D printed project yet, requiring the assembly of 8 individual prints.

A - These are lilies, representative of the Virgin Mary's innocence. I couldn't find an .svg file of the style I wanted so these are rendered in two-tone and converted into an .svg to cut away from the blade.
B - A Memento Mori is often a skull or hourglass, reminding the viewer of their mortality and the fragility of life.
C - There isn't necessarily one flower that's the antithesis of the lily/Mary, so I chose black dahlias for this side as a contrasting design element.
D - The apple and snake of the Garden of Eden.
E - Demon horns and angel wings. In hindsight, I should have detailed the feathers further.
