A life-size Tombfinger kitgun from Warframe. In the game, kitguns are modular weapons you can assemble from various unique parts. I stayed true to that aspect by making the loader (the tall green section), barrel, and grip separately, joinable by screws. In the future, Iâ€™d like to make the rest of the available parts from the game and some of my own design as well. Modeled in Fusion 360. 19 inches long.
