A life-size Consuming Dark from Path of Exile. Making a curving shape for the handle was surprisingly difficult, it took a lot of tweaking for the profiles of the sweep before I got to a shape I was happy with. I am planning to follow up this project in the future, using the blade to make a mold and cast a resin blade for the translucent look it has in the game. Modeled in Fusion 360. 16 inches long.
