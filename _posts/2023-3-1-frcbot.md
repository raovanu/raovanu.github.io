This is my FIRST Robotics Competition Robot from the 2023 season.

The most innovative part of this robot, and the one that took the longest to get right, is the "intake" or basically what interacts with the game objects first. In the 2022-23 season, the game objects were a squishy inflatable purple cube about 10 inches a side and a traffic cone about 13 inches tall. This immediately presented a problem as to how you could intake both objects with a single mechanism. Our solution was a "vacuum" type assembly with a ring of flex wheels able to accomodate both the cube and the square base of the cone.

<p style="float:left;">This is a test of the mechanism demonstrating its ability to pick up cones, especially those that are off-axis - something not many other solutions were capable of. Later in the season, after adding a "shooter" with more flex wheels above the intake, we focused on the cube delivery rather than cones. Our system was faster for cubes than the meta intake consisting of two roller bars, and the demand for fallen cones on the ground was not as high as we expected, with most teams opting to intake oriented cones fed by a human at a station off to the side of the arena. This robot took us to the Worlds competition (the international level) in Houston. We also won a sustainability award at every level of competition.</p>
