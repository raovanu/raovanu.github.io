<!-- Content -->
<p>I'm Vanu, a first-year mechanical engineering student at the University of Washington. I have a strong interest in additive manufacturing, robotics, and product design. My first exposure to CAD was over 10 years ago through Blender, a direct modeling program generally used for CGI. A passion for design developed as I learned parametric modeling through Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360. I started 3D printing in 2017 and I haven't stopped since.</p>

		<h3>UW Formula Motorsports</h3>
		<p>Our team competes in the Formula Student competition, building an open-wheel electric racecar every year. As an electric powertrain engineer this year, my project is a custom inverter cold plate, a vital part of the car's cooling loop. I designed and assembled a milled version and am currently working on a topology optimized, additively manufactured version for use by next year.</p>

		<h3>Newport Rocketry Club</h3>
		<p>We participated in the American Rocketry Contest in high school, an annual competition to build and fly a rocket to an altitude target and recover it within a time range. With a highly modular framework, I co-captained a team of 10 to win the national competiton and place second at the International Rocketry Challenge in London in 2022.</p>

		<h3>Newport Robotics Group</h3>
		<p>We designed robots to participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition, accomplishing certin tasks in a "game" to score points. As CAD Lead, I taught a subteam of ~20 design principles and worked on the top level design of our robots. We qualified for and competed at Worlds (the international competition) in 2023, also receiving a Sustainability award at district, regional, and international levels.</p>
